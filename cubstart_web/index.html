        <p> For these peaceful days――there's a secret behind it all.
        A secret organization that prevents crimes: “DA - Direct Attack”.
            And their group of all-girl agents: <strong><i>“Lycoris”</i></strong>.</p>

        <p> This peaceful everyday life is all thanks to these young girls.</p>

        <p> The elite <strong>Chisato Nishikigi</strong> is the strongest Lycoris agent of all time.
            Alongside is <strong>Takina Inoue</strong>, the talented but mysterious Lycoris. </p>

        <p> They work together at one of its branches-<strong>Café LycoReco</strong>.</p>

        <p> Here, the orders this café takes range from coffee and sweets to
            childcare, shopping, teaching Japanese to foreign students, etc.</p>
