# Introduction to Building Apps

## Course Overview 

Central to many aspects of software engineering, full stack development using modern tech stacks is often overlooked by traditional course offerings.
The difficulty of acquiring these developmental skillsets is undeniable, especially for those with no prior/limited experience wanting to break into tech. Cubstart provides unique weekly guided full-stack projects, mentorship, and technical workshops.
The final project of the semester will be dedicated to applying your skills to develop a viable product/application with a team.

## Course Material 

The course content is split into lectures, labs, homework, and a final project. Your final project will be in teams of up to 4, so you can team up with friends or find teammates in lab and lecture. We will also have an option for random groupiings for those who don't have groups.

## Lectures 

The weekly lectures are intended to give an introduction to the contents covered by the homework due the following week. The general structure will be a conceptual overview of the highlighted topics, use cases, and real-life examples. Attendance will be recorded.

## Labs 

Labs are a fun way to learn and practice the content in a more hands-on way! We have all sorts of exciting exercises for you to make your own demos and small apps.
They also serve as a means of introducing the homework assignment (that was assigned the previous week) for those who are struggling to grasp certain concepts or haven't gotten around to doing the assigned homework.

Web: The first hour of lab is required. The second half of lab serves as office hours / homework party and is optional, but highly recommended for those new to programming.

## Learning Goals 

- Tackling detailed project specs
- Project ideation and developing software in a team
